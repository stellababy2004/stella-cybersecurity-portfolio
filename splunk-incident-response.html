    <h1>Reducing Incident Response Time by 30% Using Splunk</h1>
    <p>In this project, I focused on improving the efficiency of security incident response processes using Splunk.</p>
    <p>By streamlining detection, triage, and escalation workflows, and developing custom correlation rules, I successfully reduced incident response time by 30%.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I implemented automated reporting workflows, contributing to improved operational risk management and a stronger overall security posture.</p>
